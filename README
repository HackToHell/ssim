OSSIM is open source log collection and security event correlation system. OSSIM downloads are available at http://alienvault.com/download-ossim

This is an erlang/OTP based implementation of OSSIM event collection and correlation server. It is indended to work directly with ossim-agent and 
does not require any additional OSSIM components (database, framework, UI are not needed).

The riak is being used as primarily storage system and RabbitMQ is used as messaging platform between system components. Simple UI will be released
later at one point.
